## Summary

 - Born at 1996 (24 Years old).
 - Living in Tehran, Iran.
 - Highly Experienced in Elixir/ErlangOTP.
 - Cloud Infrastructure enthusiast.
 - In love with free and open source software.
 - Former C# developer.
 - Linux system administrator.
 - Love clean and good code.

Starting from age of 14 I've became interested in computer software development and started learning. 
Since then, I've been continuously learning and perfecting my skills besides working in IT industry.

## Professional History

### DevOps Engineer - [Around](https://www.aroundco.com/) (Ongoing 2018-ongoing)

My responsibilities in Around were a bit complicated. Since the team was not mature enough when I joined.

I started in Around by developing a Highly scalable chat service using Elixir.

The second project was to deploy and maintain the infrastructure required for deployment of all the back-end
services and help making their applications cloud friendly. (They were using PHP at the time)

Since the codebase of their back-end projects were not clean and the performance was awful, They decided that
rewriting that is the best solution they have. So I proposed using Elixir and since they were mind-blown by the
performance of the previously developed chat service with Elixir, They agreed.

So now I am **DevOps Engineer and Lead Back-end developer** in Around.

Technologies used:

 - Kubernetes
 - AWS
   - EC2
   - S3
   - ECR
 - Elixir (Backend and chat)
 - Cassandra (Chat database)
 - PostgreSQL (Main Database)
 - Elasticsearch (Logs and analysis)
 - Prometheus (Cluster monitoring)

### DevOps Engineer - [Soroush Mehr](https://soroushmehr.com) (2 Years 2017-2019)

Deployed a bare-metal kubernetes cluster (2018) in a private datacenter and migrated tens of applications to the new
cloud environment.

Also done management and monitoring of the datacenter and the applications in both pre-cloud and post-cloud eras.

Technologies used:

 - Elixir (Rewrote many things and many new things)
 - Docker (Containerization of application)
 - Kubernetes (Cloud orchestrator)
 - Debian (For the stability)
 - Windows server 2012, 2016 and 2019 (Legacy applications)
 - Zabbix (Monitoring)
 - Prometheus + Grafana (Cloud native monitoring)
 - C#.NET (Legacy applications support)

### Back-end Developer - [Resaneh 24](https://www.resaneh24.com/) (3 Years 2015-2018)

Developed the back-end of a social networking application called `ManMamanam`.
The back-end had many challenges. One big challenge was a chat service which should have worked with very
bad network conditions and encrypted. So we chose to design a new protocol over TCP/IP which we called Zigor.

This protocol used very low network resources and performed well in bad connectivity scenarios where
a steady TLS connection was not possible.

Also helped at developing front-end of the management panel.

Technologies used:

 - RabbitMQ (Message broker for chat service)
 - MongoDB  (Chat database with sharding and replication)
 - NodeJS   (Media CDN services)
 - C#.NET API Backend of application
 - Microsoft SQL Server
 - AngularJS

ManMamanam is currently downloadable from googles play store.

### VoIP Engineer - [Soroush Mehr](https://soroushmehr.com) (Ongoing 2014-ongoing)

Deployed a cluster of asterisk servers with support for more than 15K concurrent calls managed using 
Asterisks' FastAGI.

Some challenges were to design a modular system which AGI plans were able to mutate without interruption
and to sync all the PBX nodes with one central service which may share state.

Technologies used:

 - Asterisk PBX Software (On debian 7 with DAHDI E1/T1 Cards)
 - Microsoft SQL Server
 - C#.NET as a FastAGI Server.


### ASP.NET Web Developer - [Soroush Mehr](https://soroushmehr.com) (2 Years 2011-2014)

Web development using Microsoft ASP.NET WebForms and MVC.

Designed many websites using the following technologies.

 - ASP.NET MVC
 - ASP.NET WebForms
 - Microsoft SQL Server
 - jQuery and Ajax
 - Twitter Bootstrap

## Education

### Computer Software Engineering - Islamic Azad University (2015-2019)

Bachelor degreee in computer software engineering from Islamic Azad University.

### English translation - Islamic Azad University (2019-Ongoing)

Since IRAN universities does not have much to offer for me in my field of interest in computer science,
I went for this major because:

I love the English language hence I went to university to pursue this passion of mine in a deeper and meaningful way.

## Skills

I mainly concentrate on back-end development and infrastructure management. Here are my skills related to these topics.

 - Elixir/Erlang: For developing concurrent, scalable and relatively fast applications.
 - Docker: I think every developer should know how to and why work with containers.
 - Kubernetes: Help with easier deployment, Higher availability and scaling like a breeze.
 - Rust: When there is a low-level or a computational workload.
 - GNU + Linux: Administration of GNU + Linux based systems.

Also there are many other aspects of tech that I am interested into.

 - 3D Priting: Built a 3D printer machine (prusa i3) and experienced in printing.
 - Embedded systems: I really like tiny computers. RaspberriPi, ESP8266, ESP32, NanoPi NEO2. Done many projects with them.
 - VoIP: As a former VoIP engineer I am experienced with high call loads, codecs and transcoding optimization using asterisk.
 - Building PCs: Built lots of normal and gaming PCs for my co-workers and some other costumers.

Thank you for reading my resume,
